	•	Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the project.
	•	Mocha: Test framework for organizing and running tests.
	•	Chai (optional): Assertion library for verifying test results.
	•	JSON: For data-driven testing.
 
## Features
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Organized structure for scalable and maintainable automation.
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Input data for tests is managed using JSON files.
- **Reusable Utilities:** Includes custom scripts for logging, data parsing, and browser setup/teardown.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Tests can run on different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
